# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
I was hired to help Dana, a data journalist, set up a web site powered by JavaScript that would let users look up UFO sightings. Her hometown has an annual UFO festival, and she has long had an interest in UFO sightings both from her home town and around the world. To coincide with an article Dana plans to write about UFOs, she wants to set up a sight that will let her readers search for themselves, to find UFO sightings near them.

Dana has brought with her a JSON file of UFO sightings. I will use that as a database from which users can draw through an interactive filter on the web site Dana and I are building.

## Results: 
Dana had already written some copy for the home page. I separated the page into two columns: a sidebar that was 4 columns wide, and a wider column for content that was 8 columns wide. I put Dana's title in the side column, then put her copy in the wider column. I gave everything a cool "dark mode" look, using the HTML class called "bg=dark."

## Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
